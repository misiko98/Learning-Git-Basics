# Learning-Git-Basics

# Project Description
  This is just an empty Repository to learn the basics of Git. Nothing Much. A good Readme should have a project description
  
  A good Readme must include a licence type in the readme. This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT Licence. Do what you wish after all 
  there is nothing here.
