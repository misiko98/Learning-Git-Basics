# Learning-Git-Basics

# Project Description
  This is just an empty Repository to learn the basics of Git. Nothing Much. A good Readme should have a project description
  
  A good Readme must include a licence type in the readme. This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT Licence. Do what you wish after all 
  there is nothing here.
  
  Added this line while learning about creating branches which happen to be snapshots.
  I will come back to this line sometiime in future. Kenneth Misiko Kunusia
